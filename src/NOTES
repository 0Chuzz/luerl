Implementation Notes
--------------------

All tables are orddicts. We use this information when building/
processing tables. Seems like Lua internaly stores elements as a
(unordered) sequence of key-value elements.

The table table can be either an ordict, an array or use the process
dictionary; these are accessed through macros. To use ETS would need a
bigger change as copying the whole table for each access would be very
inefficient. Either use bags and have one per table or sue sets and
have the ETS key as {Tab,Key}.

Lua implementation "features"
-----------------------------

When "integers" are wanted then float input values are often "rounded"
to the correct float value. So 1.3 --> 1.0 and 3.7 --> 4.0.
